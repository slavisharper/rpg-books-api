## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within RPG Books, I encourage you to report it to us as soon as possible.

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Submit a detailed report by email to slavicvetanov@gmail.com. Include a clear description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it, if applicable.
2. I will acknowledge your email within a couple business days and provide a plan of how the issue will be resolved.
3. Once the issue has been resolved, I will notify you and provide any necessary information or updates.

Please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had a chance to review and address it.

- Provide a clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- Include any necessary steps to reproduce the vulnerability, along with any relevant code or configuration samples.
